# Kotlin Web Application for Weather and Insights

This web application allows users to query current weather conditions using the OpenWeatherMap API based on the state code, country code, and city. Additionally, it provides insights generated by the OpenAI API based on the weather forecast for the selected area. This is all captured in a H2 database and then dynamically rendered in a html page.
